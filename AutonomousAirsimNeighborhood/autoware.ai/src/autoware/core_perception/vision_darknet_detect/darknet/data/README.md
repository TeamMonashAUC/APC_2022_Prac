# YOLO Algorithm Pre-Trained Weights
The yolov3.weights is the pre-trained weights file for the yolo v3 algorithm to work. You will have to make a directory called data in 
$HOME/APC_2022_Prac/AutonomousAirsimNeighborhood/autoware.ai/install/vision_darknet_detect/share/vision_darknet_detect/darknet and 
copy this file into $HOME/APC_2022_Prac/AutonomousAirsimNeighborhood/autoware.ai/install/vision_darknet_detect/share/vision_darknet_detect/darknet/data
